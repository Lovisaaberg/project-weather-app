# Weather App

This project is about building a simple weather app that uses a weather API to tell today's weather, city, temp, sunrise/sunset and a 5-day forecast. The requirements was also to follow a design example as closely as possible and that it should be responsive on devices from 320px width up to 1600px.

## The problem

I started with choosing a design from 2 examples, and since I was going to work in different branches I laid out the base in the master branch and then I created different branches for different features.

The first problem I had was to show the sunrise/sunset in the right time format. But after using Google and testing a lot I found a solution. The next problem was to crate a function to show the different colors depending on the weather. I first tried with the switch statement but I just couldn't get it to work, so I changed it to an if else statement instead. Last I added the styling and that was both challenging and fun.

The next step would be to add the ability to search on more cities for the user and maybe small tweaks on the design.
